DRAW.bat - creates .drw files for both all input .log files

seek_in_layers.ma - model specification for the seek model

seek_multiple_single.ev and seek_multiple_cons.ev and seek_multiple_coll.ev- event files for the simulations

seek_in_layers.val - initial values for the "Desired Velocity" Layer in the seek model

seek*.pal - palette files for cdModeler
