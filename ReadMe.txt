Use the following file to decide the parameters to use to run the simulations.


DEMO.bat - executes the seek model using three event files - one short one with a three inputs, the second with an exhaustive list of consecutive tests, and the third with an exhaustive list designed to generate collisions (the last two take a while to run).

DRAW.bat - creates .drw files for both all input .log files

seek_in_layers.ma - model specification for the seek model

seek_multiple_single.ev and seek_multiple_cons.ev and seek_multiple_coll.ev- event files for the simulations

seek_in_layers.val - initial values for the "Desired Velocity" Layer in the seek model

seek*.pal - palette files for cdModeler
vrml.pal - palette file for the VRMLGUI tool
